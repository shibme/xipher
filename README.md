Xipher is a curated collection of cryptographic primitives put together to perform key/password based asymmetric encryption.

## What does it do?
- Allows sharing of data securely between two parties over an insecure channel using asymmetric encryption.
- The sender encrypts the data using a public key (of the receiver - usually derived from a password) and shares the encrypted data with the receiver.
- The receiver decrypts the data using the secret key (or password).

## Key Aspects
- Encrypts data with the public key generated based on a password.
- Supports stream cipher along with stream compression, resulting in lower memory footprint and smaller ciphertext.
- Supports post-quantum cryptography using the Kyber1024 algorithm.

## CLI
Download the latest binary from the [releases](https://github.com/shibme/xipher/releases/latest) page and add it to your path.

```

### GitHub Actions
You can also use Xipher in your GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
steps:
- name: Setup Xipher
  uses: shibme/xipher@v1
```

A specific version of Xipher CLI can also be installed:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Setup Xipher
  uses: shibme/xipher@v1
  with:
    version: 1.11.0
```

## Web Interface
A web interface interoperable with the CLI, implemented using [web assembly](#web-assembly) is available [here](https://xipher.org).

You can also host it on your own GitHub Pages by setting up a workflow file like the one below. Make sure to enable Actions as the source for GitHub Pages under your repository settings.
```yaml
name: Publish Xipher Web

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  pages:
    name: Run GitHub Pages Workflow
    uses: shibme/xipher/.github/workflows/pages.yaml@main
```

### How does Xipher Web App work?
- Receiver opens the Xipher web app on a browser.
- Xipher generates a key pair and stores them in the browser local storage.
- The Xiher web app returns the public key as a URL that can be shared.
- Receiver shares the encryption URL (this contains the public key as a parameter) with the sender.
- Sender opens the public encryption URL (opens Xipher encryption web page).
- Sender inputs the data that needs to be encrypted.
- Xipher encrypts the data using the public key from the URL.
- Xipher returns ciphertext encrypted with the public key.
- Sender sends the encrypted ciphertext to the receiver.
- Receiver inputs the ciphertext in the decryption page.
- Xipher decrypts the ciphertext using the secret key from local storage.
- Xipher returns decrypted data.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the workflow of the web app.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant RX as Xipher<br>(on Browser)
actor Receiver
actor Sender
participant SX as Xipher<br>(on Browser)
    Receiver-->>+RX: Opens Xipher App on browser
    RX-->>RX: Generates a key pair and stores them in the browser local storage
    RX-->>-Receiver: Returns the Public Key<br>(as a URL that can be shared)
    Receiver->>+Sender: Shares the encryption URL<br>(this contains the public key as parameter)
    Sender-->>+SX: Opens the public encryption URL<br>(opens Xipher encryption web page)
    Sender-->>SX: Inputs the data that needs to be encrypted
    SX-->>SX: Encrypts the data using the public key from the URL
    SX-->>-Sender: Returns ciphertext encrypted with the Public Key
    Sender->>-Receiver: Sends the encrypted ciphertext to the Receiver
    Receiver-->>+RX: Inputs the ciphertext<br>(in the decyrption page)
    RX-->>RX: Decrypts the ciphertext<br>(using the secret key from local storage)
    RX-->>-Receiver: Returns decrypted data
```

## Using as a Go package
Install the package
```sh
go get -u xipher.org/xipher
```
Use it in your code
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/base32"
	"fmt"

	"xipher.org/xipher"
)

func main() {
	// Creating a new secret key for password
	scrtKey, err := xipher.NewSecretKeyForPassword([]byte("Paws0meKittyKuwan!"))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Deriving  public key from secret key
	pubKey, err := scrtKey.PublicKey(false)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	publicKeyBytes, err := pubKey.Bytes()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("PublicKey:", base32.StdEncoding.WithPadding(base32.NoPadding).EncodeToString(publicKeyBytes))

	platinText := []byte("Hello World!")

	// Encrypting plain text with public key
	cipherText, err := pubKey.Encrypt(platinText, true)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Encrypted:", base32.StdEncoding.WithPadding(base32.NoPadding).EncodeToString(cipherText))

	// Decrypting cipher text with secret key
	plainText, err := scrtKey.Decrypt(cipherText)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Decrypted:", string(plainText))
}
```

## Web Assembly
To use xipher as a web assembly (wasm) module in a browser app, follow the example below.
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
		<script src="https://xipher.org/wasm/wasm_exec.js"></script>
		<script>
			const go = new Go();
			WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("https://xipher.org/wasm/xipher.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) => {
				go.run(result.instance);
			});
		</script>
	</head>
<body>
	Call wasm methods that begin with xipher. For example: xipherNewSecretKey()
</body>
</html>
```

## Under the hood
Xipher uses the following algorithms and libraries to achieve its functionality:
- [Argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) for password hashing.
- [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) for elliptic curve cryptography.
- [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) using [CIRCL](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl) library for post-quantum cryptography.
- [XChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) for symmetric encryption.
- [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) for compression.

## Workflow
The following sequence diagram illustrates the workflow of Xipher in encrypting data using a password based public key.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant RX as Xipher
actor Receiver
actor Sender
participant SX as Xipher
    Receiver-->>+RX: Derive public (inputs password)
    RX-->>-Receiver: Returns Public Key
    Receiver->>Sender: Shares Public Key
    Sender-->>+SX: Encrypt data with public key
    SX-->>-Sender: Returns ciphertext encrypted with Public Key
    Sender->>Receiver: Sends the encrypted ciphertext to the Receiver
    Receiver-->>+RX: Decrypt data (inputs ciphertext and password)
    RX-->>-Receiver: Returns decrypted data
```
